# Removing Numts
<br>
Numts (pronounced "new mights") are mitochondrial DNA segments that have been <br>
transposed into the nuclear genome. If you work with mitochondrial genome data <br>
they're a problem as there's no
** good **
way to identify them. <br>
Numts have different properties including a different rate of molecular evolution <br>
and a different mode of inheritance. In general if you know that your data are single <br>
source then Numts don't tend to be a problem; most of the time the majorty basecall is correct.<br> However, if you're trying to call heteroplasmies or think you may have <br> a mixture of DNAs it would be good to remove such sequences from your analysis. <br><br>
