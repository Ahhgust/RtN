This is a version of RtN that runs on Windows 10. <br>
It is a statically linked binary for use with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (WSL)<br>
WSL is a project that I am cautiously optimistic about for porting 
Linux-style applications to Windows...
WSL is the only officially supported way of running RtN on Windows...
